# Tic tac toe with min max

### cool features:

- TDD(catch2)

- move semantics

- modern c++ features(STL, algorithm)

- multithreading(for size <7 it's worse than without it, but only slightly, it's just a cost of making new threads)

- SOLID (in progress)

- RAII

# TODO:

## Random

- make code more SOLID
